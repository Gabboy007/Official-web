            <h2 style="color: #C59D3B;">Hi, I'm Gozun Adrian</h2>
            <p>I'm a computer engineering student, teacher, and freelance Arduino mentor with a passion for electronics, automation, and innovation. I specialize in Arduino-based projects, guiding students and researchers through coding, wiring, and system integration. With my NC2 certification in Electrical Installation and Maintenance, I also have hands-on experience in hardware development.</p>

                <h3>Guidance from Jasper Alberto </h3>
                <p>More than just a mentor, Jasper Alberto has been like a teacher, a brother, and a constant source of support in both my projects and my life. He has always been by my side, guiding me through challenges and pushing me to become better. As my mentor in Arduino, he helped me understand how things work, troubleshoot issues, and develop problem-solving skills. He wasn’t just there to assist with technical problems—he inspired me to grow as a person. He was the one who encouraged me to change for the better, and for that, I will always be grateful</p>

                <h3>Learning with Sonny Agot</h3>
                <p>he was the one who introduced me to the world of electrical work and played a crucial role in helping me become a certified electrician. Under his guidance, I earned my NC2 in Electrical Installation and Maintenance (EIM), a milestone that shaped my skills and confidence in the field. But beyond technical knowledge, he saw potential in me that I hadn't yet realized. He was the one who encouraged me to become a teacher, inspiring me to pass on knowledge just as he did for me. His guidance has been invaluable, and I will always be grateful for his support</p>
